# Project: Phase 3

## Description
Hello! Thank you for taking the time to check out my simple Python application. It allows you to find averages, insert and delete records, and view database tables. I designed it so you can use any MySQL database, not just a specific one.

## Set-Up:

### Prerequisites
- Any MySQL Database already set up
-  Python 3.12 or above (especially if you're not on Windows)

### Steps
1. After unzipping the folder, you should see two directories:
	Source Code — contains all the source code
	Application — contains the executable file 

2a. To run the executable: Simply double-click the executable file inside the Application folder.

2b. To run the source code yourself: Open a terminal, naviagate to the Source Code Older and run:
	python proj3.py
## Usage

### Options
In File > Options, you are able to change the database's settings.

### Queries
You can use four types of queries in this database

#### View
Select this query and the table you'd like to view. The table's data will appear at the bottom of the window.

#### Average
Select this query and choose a table. You'll then select a numeric column to calculate its average.

#### Insert
Choose this query and select the table you'd like to insert a record into. A pop-up will display the table's attributes—just fill in the blanks and hit Submit.

#### Delete
Choose this query and select the table from which you'd like to delete a record. The app assumes the primary key and lets you input the key of the record to be deleted.

## Acknowledgements
This project was written for a class at New Mexico State University (C S 482) taught by Dr. Nagarkar. The database used was created for Project: Phase 1, and this project is an expansion of that work.

## P.S
CHOOSE KINDNESS: this disgusting smell of this code is the rotting code spaghetti of writing at 2am. I don't normally write code in python and I REFUSE to go back to JavaFX (I hate JavaFX with a passion).
